# Digital-Organisms (Time as Metamorphosis)

_Time as Metamorphosis_ is an interactive p5.js piece where **webcam light** controls how a small ecosystem evolves. Instead of using a fixed timer, the sketch uses **“growth time”** that speeds up in bright light and slows down in darkness.

- **Cocoons** start at staggered times in this growth-time and **crack** then **hatch** when they hit growth thresholds, not fixed seconds.
- When a cocoon hatches, the **real time** it took becomes the butterfly’s **body size**:  
  fast, bright development → smaller adults; slow, dim development → larger adults.
- **Butterflies** flock using boids rules and are drawn to:
  - **Nectar points** you place with mouse clicks  
  - Your **mouse** as a roaming “sun” when no nectar exists
- The **sky, sun/moon, and color palette** shift with brightness, making the whole scene a kind of **living clock**, where time feels elastic and environmental.

The project contrasts a small digital organism’s adaptive, context-based time with the rigid MM:SS clock in the corner, asking what it would mean if our devices followed **living systems’ rhythms** instead of fixed countdowns.
